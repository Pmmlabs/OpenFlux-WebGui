## This fork

Fork of [p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux](https://github.com/p1neappleXpress/OpenFlux)
(based on `0.0.3`), combining this fork's own work with hardening adopted
from the community fork [danusha2345/OpenFlux](https://github.com/danusha2345/OpenFlux).
Changes on top of upstream:

- **Multi-client exit node + local web admin panel** (`--role=exit-panel`) —
  run many clients in one process, each on its own Yandex.Docs / Volga / MAX /
  Cups.online / Mail.ru document or room, with a login-gated local web UI to
  add and remove them live — no restart needed. Every client shares the
  panel's own Noise static identity; a per-client PSK file optionally closes
  one client to strangers. See
  [Exit node - multi-client admin panel](#exit-node---multi-client-admin-panel).
- **Noise NKpsk0 encryption** (X25519 + AES-256-GCM, rotating session keys)
  replaces the old static-AES-GCM transport encryption; required by default
  unless `--allow-plaintext` is passed.
- **Multi-stream transport** — `--url` takes a comma-separated document list
  (yandex/vyandex), spreading connections across them with failover to the
  others if one dies.
- **`--upstream-proxy`** — the exit node can itself dial out through an
  upstream SOCKS5 proxy instead of the internet directly.
- **`netguard`** — an SSRF denylist blocking private/loopback/link-local and
  cloud-metadata destinations on the exit node by default (`--allow-private`
  to disable).
- **~20 correctness/robustness/security fixes** on the exit-node and
  transport paths, each with a regression test: two remote-triggerable
  panics, a decompression-bomb DoS, `--local-ip` being silently ignored, a
  client RST never reaching the real destination, an unbounded memory/goroutine
  leak on stalled L4 relays, silently-swallowed transport send errors, a
  conntrack lock that blocked all packet forwarding during its sweep, no
  graceful shutdown on SIGTERM, a conntrack entry-count cap, half-close on
  every data path instead of a hard close, SOCKS5 RFC 1928 compliance
  (IPv6, error replies, exact-length reads), and reconnect/keepalive fixes
  across the Yandex/Volga/MAX/Mail.ru transports.
- **iOS bridge not maintained here** — `export_ios.go` builds under
  `//go:build ios` (inherited from upstream/the community fork) but this
  fork ships no iOS app or CI job for it.
- `build_android.sh` is now host-OS aware (macOS/Linux/Windows) and builds
  all three ABIs the [Android app fork](https://github.com/Kingofthedivanich/OpenFluxAndroid)
  ships, instead of just `arm64-v8a` from a macOS host.

## Architecture

> **Encryption is optional** (Noise `NKpsk0`): without key flags the tunnel
> runs plaintext. To encrypt, start the exit with `--exit-key-file` (the key
> is created on first run) and the client with `--peer-key`; or share just a
> `--psk-file` between both peers for the PSK-only mode (AES-256-GCM, no
> handshake, no key files). All clients (desktop, iOS, Android) use the
> **batched** codec and the same wire format.

Any client works with either exit backend. `--mode` is chosen on the **exit
node**, not on the client.

```
Client (any):  macOS (utun) / Linux / Windows / iOS (packet tunnel) / Android
                    |
                    v
               Transport (Yandex.Docs / Volga / MAX / Cups / Mail.ru)
                    |
                    v
               Exit node  -->  Internet
                 --mode l3   (raw SNAT/DNAT, Linux + root)
                 --mode l4   (gVisor proxy, any platform)
```

| Client (any)                            | Exit backend | Requires              |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| macOS / Linux / Windows / iOS / Android | `--mode l3`  | exit on Linux + root  |
| macOS / Linux / Windows / iOS / Android | `--mode l4`  | nothing               |

In `l3`, the exit node terminates nothing: it forwards raw IP packets with
SNAT/DNAT (conntrack + egress-IP filter). One TCP connection end-to-end
between the client and the real server.

In `l4`, the exit node terminates TCP in a userspace gVisor stack, then
re-dials the real server with `net.Dial`. Works on any OS, no root.

The client terminates TCP locally (gVisor, utun, or NEPacketTunnelProvider),
then sends raw IP packets into the transport.

## Exit-node backends

The exit node has exactly **two** backends, selected with `--mode` on the
**exit node**. The client does not choose a backend - the same client works
against either.

| `--mode` | Backend | Forwarding | Requires | Platforms |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `l3` | Raw L3 | SNAT/DNAT on raw IPv4 via SOCK_RAW + conntrack. No userspace TCP stack. | root / CAP_NET_RAW | Linux only |
| `l4` (alias `proxy`) | gVisor proxy | Terminates TCP in a userspace gVisor stack, then `net.Dial` to the real server. | nothing | Linux, macOS, Windows |

- `proxy` is a deprecated alias for `l4`; both select the same backend.
  `l4` is the canonical name going forward.
- **l3 is faster** (single end-to-end TCP connection, no double termination)
  but Linux-only and needs root.
- **l4 works everywhere** without root, at the cost of terminating TCP twice
  (client -> gVisor on exit -> real server).
- On Linux with root, prefer `l3`. On Windows, the intended path is `l3`
  inside a lightweight QEMU VM (see TODO) - the WinDivert backend is not wired
  yet, and `l4` is the working fallback until QEMU is shipped. On non-root
  hosts, use `l4`.

### l3 and kernel RSTs

In `l3` mode the kernel sees return packets for connections it never opened
and emits RSTs, tearing the tunnel connections down. Drop them:

```
# Scoped (recommended): assign a dedicated egress IP, run with --local-ip, then:
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -s <egress-ip> -j DROP

# Host-wide fallback (drops ALL outbound RST; makes closed ports look filtered):
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP
```

The L3 code additionally drops client-originated RSTs before `sendto()`, so
the kernel rule above is only needed for kernel-generated RSTs.

## Highlights

- **Pluggable transports** - Yandex.Docs (WS), Yandex Volga (HTTP relay + WS),
  MAX/OneMe (WebRTC DataChannel), Cups.online (Centrifugo rooms),
  Mail.ru Docs (WS).
- **Batched + zstd codec** - coalesces many tunnel packets into a single
  transport message. Fewer channel messages, higher throughput. See
  `transport/batched.go` and `transport/framing.go`.
- **Two exit backends** - `l3` (raw SNAT/DNAT) and `l4` (gVisor proxy).
  See [Exit-node backends](#exit-node-backends).
- **macOS utun client** - `--inbound=tun` (default on macOS). Creates a utun
  interface, watches its own sockets to install bypass routes, then takes
  the default route. No SOCKS5, no gVisor on the client.
- **iOS packet tunnel** - NEPacketTunnelProvider, pure L3 forwarding.
- **Legacy codec** - `--codec=legacy` reverts to the old per-packet LZ4 codec
  (compatible with older clients).
- **Optional encryption** - `--exit-key-file` on the exit node and `--peer-key`
  on the client run a Noise `NKpsk0` handshake (X25519 + AES-256-GCM) over the
  channel; session keys rotate every 2 minutes. `--psk-file` on both sides
  closes the node to clients without the secret.
- **Benchmark modes** - `--role=bench-send --bench-bytes=N` / `--role=bench-sink`
  measure raw goodput through the transport without touching the host network.

## Requirements

1. **Go** - to build the desktop client / exit-node binary. See `go.mod` for
   the exact version.
2. **Android NDK r27+** - to build the Android client binary.
3. **Xcode 26.6+** - to build the iOS client binary.
4. **A Linux VPS / VDS** for the exit node. The `l3` backend requires root;
   `l4` works without.

## Build

```
go mod tidy
go build -o openflux .
```

Cross-build for the exit node (Linux amd64), stripped:

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 \
    go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o openflux-linux .
```

## Usage

### Exit node - L3 (Linux, root)

```
sudo ./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Requires root / CAP_NET_RAW. Install the iptables rule (see
[l3 and kernel RSTs](#l3-and-kernel-rsts)).

### Exit node - L4 (any OS, no root)

```
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l4 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Fallback for platforms where `l3` is unavailable (Windows without WinDivert,
macOS, non-root Linux). Slower than `l3` (double TCP termination).

### Exit node - multi-client admin panel

```
./openflux --role=exit-panel \
    --panel-addr=127.0.0.1:8088 \
    --panel-user=admin --panel-pass=CHANGE_ME \
    --panel-data=./clients.json --panel-key-file=./panel.key
```

Runs many clients in one process, each with its own transport (its own
document/room) and its own independent `l4` tunnel — one client's traffic
never crosses into another's. Clients are managed live through a local,
login-gated web UI at `--panel-addr` (add/remove, see status and stats) with
no restart needed; registrations persist to `--panel-data` and reload on the
next start. `--panel-addr` should stay bound to `127.0.0.1`; reach it
remotely over an SSH tunnel (`ssh -L 8088:127.0.0.1:8088 user@host`) rather
than exposing it directly. `l3` isn't offered here — see the plain `--role=exit`
above if you need raw SNAT/DNAT.

`--panel-key-file` is the panel's own Noise static key, created on first run
and printed at startup; every client shares this same identity and connects
with `--peer-key=<that public key>`. Adding a client in the UI accepts an
optional PSK file to close just that one client to anyone without the secret.

### Updating a deployed exit node

Every tagged release publishes a prebuilt `openflux-linux-amd64` (with
`--version` baked in) as a GitHub Release asset — see
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).
[`deploy/update.sh`](deploy/update.sh) downloads the latest one, swaps it
into place, and restarts the systemd service, backing up the current binary
first and rolling back automatically if the new one doesn't come up
healthy:

```
cd /root/OpenFlux && ./deploy/update.sh
```

Run it manually whenever you want to update — nothing on the box checks
for updates on its own.

### Client - macOS utun (default on macOS)

```
sudo ./openflux --role=client --inbound=tun \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL"
```

Creates a utun interface, installs bypass routes for the transport, waits for
the transport to connect, then takes the default route. No SOCKS5.
Requires sudo. All traffic except the transport goes through the tunnel.

### Client - SOCKS5 (all platforms, fallback)

```
./openflux --role=client --inbound=socks5 \
    --transport=yandex \
    --url="YOUR_YANDEX_DOC_URL" \
    --socks5=:1080
```

Point your browser / app at `127.0.0.1:1080` as a SOCKS5 proxy. This is the
default inbound on non-macOS platforms.

### Codec selection

By default the transport uses the batched + zstd codec
(`transport/batched.go` + `transport/framing.go`). For the old per-packet
LZ4 codec, pass `--codec=legacy`:

```
./openflux --role=client --codec=legacy ...
```

**Important:** the batched wire format is NOT compatible with the legacy LZ4
format. Client and exit node must both use the same codec (both new, or both
`--codec=legacy`).

### Encryption (optional)

The encrypted transport is a Noise `NKpsk0` handshake (X25519, AES-256-GCM,
SHA-256) between the client and the exit node, carried over the same channel
as the data. The exit node owns a static key pair; the client only needs its
public key. Every handshake makes fresh session keys and the client
re-handshakes every 2 minutes on WireGuard's schedule while the old session
keeps flowing, so a key that leaks later does not expose recorded traffic.
Data frames carry a 64-bit counter that is the AEAD nonce and feeds a sliding
anti-replay window.

**Exit node:** pick a file for the static key. It is created on the first run
and the public key is printed at startup:

```
./openflux --role=exit ... --exit-key-file=/etc/openflux/exit.key
```
```
=== EXIT PUBLIC KEY (generated and saved to /etc/openflux/exit.key) ===
<base64 key>
Start clients with --peer-key=<base64 key>
```

**Client:** pass that public key:

```
./openflux --role=client ... --peer-key=<base64 key>
```

**Closed node (optional):** a shared secret of 16+ characters in a file on
both sides is mixed into the handshake as a pre-shared key. The exit node then
silently ignores clients that do not have it:

```
./openflux --role=exit   ... --exit-key-file=exit.key --psk-file=secret.txt
./openflux --role=client ... --peer-key=<base64 key> --psk-file=secret.txt
```

Notes:
- The encrypted layer sits under the codec: one AEAD covers a whole batch and
  compression keeps working. Overhead is 33 bytes per batch.
- One client per document. A second client handshaking on the same document
  takes it over (without encryption it would corrupt the traffic instead).
  Give every client its own document.
- Unset means unencrypted, unchanged behavior. The old `--encryption-key-file`
  is accepted as an alias of `--psk-file` but no longer turns encryption on by
  itself, and the v1 wire format is not accepted.

### Multi-stream (several documents)

Pass a comma-separated list to `--url` (`yandex`, `vyandex`) to run one tunnel
over several documents at once. If one document dies, or the relay stops
delivering on it, the tunnel keeps working over the others (issue #50).

```
# exit node
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 \
    --url="https://disk.yandex.ru/i/AAA,https://disk.yandex.ru/i/BBB" \
    --multistream-status=10s

# client: the same documents, in any order
./openflux --role=client \
    --url="https://disk.yandex.ru/i/BBB,https://disk.yandex.ru/i/AAA" \
    --multistream-status=10s
```

How it works:

- Every document is a complete stream of its own (transport, codec,
  encryption), so each one carries the single-document wire format.
- Each TCP connection is pinned to one document; different connections spread
  over the documents. Spreading the packets of one connection over documents
  would reorder them and collapse its throughput.
- A document is preferred while the peer's keepalives arrive on it. A
  disconnected document stops getting traffic immediately; so does one whose
  participant list shows nobody but us (the peer left). One that is connected
  but silent for another reason (e.g. the peer landed on another document
  backend) is dropped after 25s.
- A connection's packets are sent over the document its packets last arrived
  on. When one side moves a connection to another document, the other side
  follows at once instead of sending its ACKs into the lost document.
- A single URL keeps the exact single-document behavior.

`--multistream-status` logs one line per interval:

```
[MULTI] connected=2/2 peer=1/2 s0[AAA]=UP(peer=3s,rx=812,tx=790,rc=0) s1[BBB]=NOPEER(peer=41s,rx=15,tx=9,rc=2)
```

`UP`: connected and the peer was heard from recently; `NOPEER`: connected but
the peer is silent; `DOWN`: not connected. On iOS, enter the comma-separated
list in the URL field.

### Benchmarks

Measure raw goodput through the transport, without touching the host network:

```
# Sender: push 100 MB
./openflux --role=bench-send --bench-bytes=100 --transport=yandex --url="..."

# Receiver: measure goodput
./openflux --role=bench-sink --transport=yandex --url="..."
```

### Other transports

```
# Yandex Volga (HTTP relay + WS)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=vyandex --url="..." --debug

# MAX / OneMe (WebRTC DataChannel)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=oneme \
    --maxToken="..." --maxUid="..." --debug

# Cups.online (Centrifugo rooms)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=cupsonline --debug
# prints a base64 room list; pass it to the client via --url

# Mail.ru Docs (WS)
./openflux --role=exit --mode=l3 --transport=mailru \
    --url="YOUR_MAILRU_PUBLIC_LINK" --debug
# accepts either a bare weblink (AbCdEfGh1/IjKlMnOp2) or a full URL
# (https://cloud.mail.ru/public/AbCdEfGh1/IjKlMnOp2)
```

`--client`, `--exit-node`, `--tun`, `--socks5-mode`, `--legacy`,
`--bench-send`, `--bench-sink`.

## Implementing custom transports

Implement the `Transport` interface from `transport/transport.go` and register
your transport in the `main.go` switch block (see `transport/mailru/` for a
complete example). The batched codec (`BatchedTransport`) wraps any transport,
so a new backend gets batching for free.

## TODO

- **L3 exit on Windows and macOS.** The L3 exit currently works on Linux
  (SOCK_RAW) only; Windows and macOS use `--mode=l4`. The `tunnel/windivert/`
  package (Windows) exists but is not wired to the L3 forwarder yet. A native
  macOS L3 exit is not implemented.
- **Run the exit node (QEMU).**
